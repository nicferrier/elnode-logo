= Logo's for Elnode =

Elnode lacked a logo for a long time, I am normally quick to draw
something.

JLF, of {{{#emacs}}} fame, suggested the idea of a cloud of GNUs.

So this is all the sources and built files from those sources that you
might need.

The original original was a sketch, by me, in
a [[http://pasteboard.co/2xriwNRN.jpg|paper notebook]]
